## AvengerCon '17 - Windows 10 Arbitrary Code Guard

With the release of Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft introduced two new
exploit mitigations for processes: Code Integrity Guard (CIG) and Arbitrary
Code Guard (ACG). These mitigations greatly increase the difficulty of browser
exploitation and have significant implications for code injection. As of build
1703, CIG and ACG are enabled by default for Microsoft Edge and Hyper-V child
processes. In this talk, we'll examine these mitigations from an attacker's
perspective and discuss how code injection might be performed in this
restricted environment.
