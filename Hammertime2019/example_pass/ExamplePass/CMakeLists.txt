# This is a work-around for an LLVM bug in the llvm-8-dev package that will
# cause a segmentation fault during llvm_shutdown(). There is an issue with
# LLVM's implementation of ManagedStatic that will cause our plugin to be
# unloaded before our pass is cleaned up. This will result in a call through a
# dangling pointer to our unloaded library. Note that this issue only manifests
# when using RegisterStandardPasses with an out-of-tree build.
#
# This issue is mentioned in a few places:
